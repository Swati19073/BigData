Please create kaggle team by your roll-number (or admission number) so we can evaluate student based on score in private leaderboard of kaggle.  Please develop machine/deep learning models using python library TensorFlow, Karas, Pytorch. 

Final prediction/output, Python code and detail should be submitted as assignment (single zip file). Please make sure prediction submitted at kaggle should be reproducible by your Python code.
Evaluation will be based performance (AUC of ROC curve) at Kaggle (Private Leaderboard) site and submitted python codes.
